# Changelog — ComfyUI Video Creator

### v1.7.5
- **Fixed: a source file with `..` in its name generated fine but could never be downloaded.** ComfyUI's `/view` endpoint refuses any filename containing `..` with a 400 — its directory-traversal guard — and rejects it *before* looking for the file. A starting image called `Married... with Children (TV Series 1987-1997).png` therefore produced a perfectly good video on the server that the app could not fetch, failing the run at the very last step after paying for the whole generation. Output names now collapse runs of dots to one (`Married._with_Children_…`); single dots like `v1.2.3_clip` are untouched, since only consecutive ones are refused.
  - Leading and trailing dots are stripped too: Windows silently drops a trailing dot when saving, which would leave the downloaded file's name disagreeing with the one the server reported.
  - Verified against a live pod: the offending name returns 400, the sanitized name returns 404 (accepted, file simply absent).

### v1.7.4
- **The header now shows how much time you have left, not just what you've spent.** With a spend limit set it reads `2h 17m  |  $4.80 / $10.00  |  4h 41m left`, amber at 80% and red at the limit. Hovering gives the hourly rate, roughly what time the limit will be reached, and a reminder that storage bills separately and isn't counted.
- **Spend now tracks the pod you're connected to, not only one the app started.** Previously a pod started by hand in the RunPod console showed no counter at all, because the header only followed pods the app had launched itself.
- **A pod started outside the app is picked up on launch** — including switching the connection to it. If the configured URL points at a pod that's now stopped but another pod is running, the app finds it and repoints the RunPod URL, instead of asking to start a third one. Only one pod runs at a time, so the running one is unambiguously the one in use.
- **Pods the app didn't start are never stopped automatically.** Adopting one records it as unowned: exit won't stop it, crash recovery won't offer to, and hitting the spend limit blocks new runs and warns rather than handing your machine back to the pool. The manual Stop Pod button still works — that's an explicit choice.

### v1.7.3
- **Fixed: a pod created after the priority order was saved was never tried.** The saved order was acting as a whitelist — any pod not in it was skipped entirely, so a brand new pod stayed invisible to the chain until someone happened to press Refresh in Settings. The order is now a *preference*: pods missing from it are appended and tried last (running ones first), so nothing on the account is ever silently ignored. Reordering in Settings still works exactly as before.

### v1.7.2
- **Fixed: a pod that was perfectly able to start got reported as unavailable.** RunPod accepts the start action *before* the pod leaves `EXITED`, so polling its status immediately read the old state — and `EXITED` was in the terminal-failure list. The chain abandoned the pod on its very first poll, while RunPod carried on booting it, which is why the same pod turned up running and "available" in the console moments later. A just-started pod is now given a 30-second grace period before an `EXITED` reading is believed. `ERROR`, `TERMINATED` and the zero-GPU check are unchanged and still reject immediately.
- **Fixed: a pod could be left running and billing.** If a pod came up with its GPU but ComfyUI never answered within the readiness window, the chain moved to the next candidate without stopping it. It is now stopped before moving on.
- **Pod chain progress is now written to `runpod_pod.log`** next to the app, timestamped and trimmed to the last 2000 lines. Previously it existed only in the on-screen log, so an intermittent failure left nothing to investigate afterwards.
- Confirmed RunPod's real capacity wording for a pinned resume: `There are not enough free GPUs on the host machine to start this pod.` — which is classified as "try the next pod", not as an error.

### v1.7.1
- **"Keep trying" when every pod is busy.** All five pods being unavailable is common — they're pinned to specific machines, so you're waiting for one particular card to free up rather than drawing from a pool. The "no pods available" dialog now offers **Keep Trying**, which re-sweeps the whole pod list on an interval until one comes up or the window expires (defaults: every **10 minutes** for **2 hours**, both configurable). The header shows `retrying — next 21:40, until 23:10` and the button becomes **Stop Retrying**.
  - **Alert sound**, ported from the Chain Automator: pick any `.wav` (played inline via `winsound`) or other audio file (handed to the shell), with a Test button. It plays both when a pod is found and when the window expires, so you know the answer from the next room either way — the header and log say which.
  - When a retry succeeds the window **raises and takes focus**, because the pod is billing from that moment.
  - Retry sweeps are silent: no modal dialog every 10 minutes, and the "none available" prompt is not re-asked mid-retry.
  - A key or rate-limit error **stops** the retry rather than repeating the same failure every interval.
  - The retry prompt states what your spend limit will do, and **warns explicitly when no limit is set** — a pod found at 2am with no limit runs until you notice.

### v1.7.0
- **Start and stop your RunPod pod from inside the app.** Previously the pod had to be woken by hand in the RunPod console before the app was any use in RunPod mode. Now the app talks to RunPod's control plane directly (REST v2, plain `requests` — no new dependency and no change to the build): on launch it offers to start a pod, tries your pods **in priority order**, and uses the first one that actually comes up, writing the proxy URL into the config itself. Only *existing* pods are ever started — nothing is created or terminated, since pods are built and approved by hand.
  - **A resume that "succeeds" isn't necessarily usable.** RunPod pins a stopped pod to the one physical machine it was created on. If that machine's GPU was rented out while the pod was stopped, RunPod starts the pod anyway **with no GPU at all** as a data-recovery mode: HTTP 200, status RUNNING, proxy URL up, ComfyUI answering — and billing the whole time while everything crawls on CPU. A pod is only accepted when `status == RUNNING` **and** `gpu.count >= 1` **and** `runtime.gpus` is non-empty; anything else is stopped immediately and the next candidate tried. This is the common failure, not an edge case.
  - **"No pods available" is a normal outcome.** Five stopped pods are five specific machines, not five draws from a pool, so all of them can be busy at once. When the chain is exhausted you're offered a switch to Local rather than shown an error.
  - **Only an unusable API key or a rate limit stops the chain.** Everything else is treated as "this pod can't run right now" and moves to the next candidate. The `POST /pods/{id}/action` request carries no variable parameters, so a `400` there cannot mean "you sent something malformed" — it means capacity, whatever wording RunPod happens to use. A `404` likewise only says *that* pod is gone, not the other four.
  - Progress is logged as `[2/5] trying …` so you can watch it work down the list, and when every pod fails the dialog carries a per-pod breakdown of exactly why each one was rejected.
  - **Double-click a pod in the Settings list** to point the RunPod URL straight at it (the proxy URL is derived from the pod id, so this needs no network call) and switch the mode across.
  - **Live spend readout in the header** — `2h 17m  |  $4.80` — with an optional **session spend limit**. At 80% it warns; at 100% it blocks new runs, lets the current generation finish, then stops the pod. Compute only (storage bills separately), and it needs the app running to act, so it's a safety net rather than a hard cap.
  - **Auto-stop on exit**, and a **crash-recovery check**: the pod the app started is recorded next to the EXE, so if the app dies without its close handler, the next launch spots the still-running pod and offers to stop it.
  - Settings gains a **RunPod pod control** group — fetch your pods, drag them into preference order, set the spend limit, and test the API key (which correctly distinguishes "RunPod is down" from "your key is rejected").
  - The API key lives in `api_keys.json` next to the app, **not** in `video_creator_config.json` — that file gets copied around on every deploy. `RUNPOD_API_KEY` in the environment overrides it.

### v1.6.8
- **Queue view: settings column dropped, prompt widened.** The seed/steps/megapixels/LoRAs column was taking a third of the width to show what's rarely the thing you're scanning for, so it moved to the row's hover tooltip. The prompt column takes that space and now **wraps to three lines** instead of being cut off after one — the thumbnail already makes each row tall enough, and an H3 prompt's opening clause often doesn't say which take it is. Full prompt still on hover.

### v1.6.7
- **The queue view now shows the frame each run starts from.** Reusing one prompt across a batch of different starting images made every text column on those rows read identically — same workflow, same prompt, same settings — so the only thing telling them apart was a filename. Each row now carries a 112×63 thumbnail of its actual starting frame: the source image for an Image → Video run, the source video's **last** frame (where the extension picks up) for a Video → Extend run.
  - Video frames come from the same `<folder>/thumbnails/<name>_last.jpg` cache the Extend grid already builds for the tile you clicked, so queueing a run never shells out to ffmpeg and never stalls the button press. If no cached frame exists (a source outside the browsed folder, or a folder that can't be written to), the cell is simply left blank.
  - Decoded thumbnails are cached per file+mtime, since every queue change rebuilds all the rows.
  - The queue window opens taller (1240×640) to fit about five thumbnail rows, still sized for a 1080p screen.

### v1.6.6
- **The run queue is now visible.** Both tabs share one queue — ComfyUI runs a single prompt at a time — and switching between Image → Video and Video → Extend while stacking runs up made "⏳ 3 queued behind this run" useless for answering the only question that matters: *is the thing I'm about to click already in there?* A new **📋 View Queue** button next to the count opens a live, non-modal list of the queue: the run in progress on top (amber), then every waiting run in the order it will go, each with its **tab, workflow, source file, settings** (seed / steps / megapixels / LoRAs / length) **and prompt**, with the full text on hover.
  - **Rows can be reordered (↑ / ↓), removed individually, or cleared all at once** — previously the only option was blowing away the entire queue. The running row can't be touched from here; cancel it from the tab that owns it, where its log and progress bar are.
  - **Queueing a duplicate now asks first.** Pressing Create/Extend for a run that matches one already running or waiting — same workflow, source, prompt, LoRAs, seed, steps, megapixels, length, input mode and Turbo setting — pops a confirmation naming the match ("queue position 2") instead of silently spending the full render time (and RunPod minutes) generating a video that's already coming. The message says whether the seed is random (result will differ) or fixed (the very same video). The check runs *before* the prompt-history entry is written, so backing out leaves no trace.
  - The inline queue label now names the next run up (`⏳ 3 queued behind this run — next: portrait_01.png (MiniMax_H3)`), and its hover tooltip lists the whole queue in order.
  - Queue log lines carry the full run description now (`Queued #2 — Video → Extend | WAN_Extend | clip_0042.mp4 | Seed: 12345 ...`) instead of just a count.

### v1.6.5
- **Library "Produced by" now falls back to the video's own embedded metadata** when no history entry names the file — which is always true for a video made via Reuse Settings, since those retries deliberately skip history logging. VHS_VideoCombine bakes the exact ComfyUI API prompt it ran into the mp4 itself; the Library now reads that directly out of the file (no ffmpeg/ffprobe needed) and runs it through the same workflow analyzer used to build the run panels, so you get the positive prompt, seed, steps, megapixels, length, and LoRAs (name + strength) even with no history entry at all.

### v1.6.4
- **LoRA picker dropdowns no longer eat the panel's scroll wheel.** Scrolling over a LoRA dropdown while it wasn't focused used to silently change the selected LoRA instead of scrolling the Options + LoRAs panel underneath it. The scroll wheel now only changes the value when you've actually clicked into the box first.
- **Restored the dropdown arrow** on every combo box — a themed `QComboBox::drop-down` with no `down-arrow` rule was rendering with no visible arrow at all, so it didn't read as a dropdown. Added the small CSS-triangle arrow already used in other apps in the repo (e.g. File Rename Mover).
- **LoRA list status now shows both sources at once** — "N from folder   ·   M from server" — instead of the folder count disappearing the moment you fetch from the server (and vice versa).

### v1.6.3
- **Library: Reuse Settings** — a video that didn't come out right no longer means hunting down the source image, copying the prompt by hand, and reselecting every LoRA/seed/step. Selecting a video with a linked history entry enables a new "🔁 Reuse Settings" button that switches to the tab it was made on (Image → Video or Video → Extend), reloads that workflow, prompt, LoRAs, seed, steps, megapixels and length — leaving you to tweak the prompt and press Create/Extend yourself.
  - **Image → Video runs never re-hunt for the original source image.** The image an I2V run started from is often a temp/staged upload that's long gone by the time you review the result, so its recorded filename is never trustworthy. Instead, the finished video's own first frame is extracted via ffmpeg into a temp cache and used as the starting image — guaranteed to exist and guaranteed to match. The extracted frame is shown as a small preview thumbnail next to the source label (new for any image selection, not just reuse) so you can see exactly what's about to run. The temp frame is named with the same `_base_stem()` stripping the Extend chain already uses (peels off the prior run's `_<workflow>_<timestamp>`), so the retry's output name comes back clean instead of doubling up.
  - **Video → Extend runs** still need the real source video (a single frame can't stand in for it), so its recorded filename is looked up in the current Video folder; if it was moved or deleted outside the app, that folder is automatically rescanned so the grid reflects what's actually there instead of erroring out, and the log says so.
  - **Saves back into the Library folder it came from**, not whichever folder happens to be the global Output folder right now — useful once you're juggling several Library folders for different projects/scenes, so a retry lands next to the video it's replacing instead of somewhere else you then have to go find it. The log names the destination folder for the run.
  - Runs started this way are **not** added to prompt history — the finished video already carries the prompt it was generated with, and logging every retry-with-a-tweak would flood the workflow's history with near-duplicates of a prompt that mostly works. History logging resumes automatically the next time a workflow is picked normally or the History dialog is used.

### v1.6.2
- **Turbo LoRA + Sampler toggle** — a new "⚡ Turbo LoRA + Sampler" checkbox appears in Options for any MiniMax H3 workflow that has one (detected automatically, whichever way the workflow file currently has it wired). Uncheck it to bypass the Turbo LoRA and swap in the standard sampler for a real, un-shortcut quality read — no more manually rewiring the graph in ComfyUI's editor to compare. A warning appears when Turbo is off and steps is set below 15, since standard sampling at a turbo-tuned step count looks worse than either option alone.

### v1.6.1
- **The Rewrite button is grayed out until LM Studio is actually reachable** — turning on the AI Rewriter toggle now pings LM Studio's `/v1/models` in the background and enables/disables the button accordingly, with a tooltip explaining why if it's off (not configured, or the server isn't running). LM Studio was never meant to be a requirement to use the app; re-checks automatically whenever you toggle it on, switch workflows, or close Settings.

### v1.6.0
- **AI Prompt Rewriter** — a new "🪄 AI Rewriter" toggle appears on the Prompts pane for any recognized MiniMax H3 workflow (T2VA/I2VA/FL2VA/L2VA/Ref2VA, auto-detected from the workflow's nodes). Turn it on, type a rough scene idea into the same prompt box you already use, hit "✨ Rewrite", and it's replaced with a correctly-formatted production prompt — right down to `<Subject N>`/`<Picture N>` labels and the six-section Ref2VA structure where that applies. For Ref2VA workflows a second field appears asking for a one-line description of the reference image(s), since the writer works from text, not pixels.
  - Runs entirely against a local LM Studio server (Settings → AI Prompt Rewriter: URL + a "Fetch models" button that lists whatever's loaded) — nothing leaves the machine. Off by default; nothing changes for anyone who doesn't turn it on.
  - The system prompt embeds MiniMax's own writing guide in full (reimplemented from the pytraveler/MiniMax-H3-Prompt-Rewriter-ComfyUI node pack's "guide" approach), so it works with *any* instruction-following model already in LM Studio — no task-specific LoRA required.
  - Guards against two real local-model failure modes found while building this: a "thinking" model burning its whole response budget on chain-of-thought and never writing the actual prompt (now flagged with a clear error instead of silently returning nothing), and a weak model copying the guide's own worked example verbatim instead of writing a new one (explicit anti-copy instruction added).
  - Default model is `openai/gpt-oss-20b` — in testing, this MoE model finished a full Ref2VA rewrite in ~7 seconds with clean, well-structured output, versus a dense 27B model that didn't finish even at a 600-second timeout for the same prompt.

### v1.5.6
- **Fixed: the window opened behind other windows on launch.** `raise_()`/`activateWindow()` alone can get silently ignored — Windows blocks a background process from stealing focus unless it looks like the user just pressed a key, which is exactly what happens starting the app from a Stream Deck shortcut. Startup now simulates a harmless Alt key tap immediately before `SetForegroundWindow`, which satisfies that check, so the window actually comes to the front on launch instead of just flashing in the taskbar.

### v1.5.5
- **Moved the queue counter where you're actually looking** — v1.5.4 put it in the top header bar next to Settings, which is easy to miss. It's now its own row directly under the Create Video / Extend Video / Cancel buttons on each tab ("⏳ N queued behind this run" + a Clear Queue button), hidden entirely when nothing's queued. Since the queue is shared between tabs, both tabs' counters stay in sync.

### v1.5.4
- **Run queue** — clicking Create Video/Extend Video while a job is already running no longer pops a "Busy" dialog; it queues the request instead, and the next one auto-starts the moment the current run finishes. ComfyUI only processes one prompt at a time, so Image and Extend tabs share a single queue. A header badge ("N queued", hover for the list) plus a Clear Queue button show what's waiting; each queued job keeps its own prompt/workflow/settings snapshot from the moment it was clicked, so changing the workflow or prompt to queue up the next one doesn't affect jobs already waiting, and results/history attach to the right entry even if the panel's selection has since moved on.
- Create Video/Extend Video buttons now stay enabled while a run is in progress (that's what makes queuing possible) instead of disabling until the active job finishes.

### v1.5.3
- **Finished-run indicator you can catch from across the room** — the progress bar turns amber and reads "DONE" (dark bold text for contrast) when a run completes, plus a system notification sound plays, so you don't need a popup window to tell a run finished while walking by. Starting a new run clears the amber back to the normal red bar.

### v1.5.2
- **Fixed misleading run log** — after queuing, the log kept showing "Queued (...) — waiting for ComfyUI" even once the run was already executing and the progress bar was moving (step/percent updates come from a separate websocket message and never touched that line). ComfyUI's first "executing" event for the run now logs "ComfyUI started processing" so the log matches what the progress bar is showing

### v1.5.1
- **Faster thumbnail loading** — the Library/Extend/Image browser grids now decode/resize (or extract video frames via ffmpeg) across a 6-worker thread pool instead of one file at a time. Biggest win is on a cold cache (first time pointing at a folder, or after files change) since it overlaps several ffmpeg processes / Pillow decodes at once; results still land in the grid in the same sorted order as before

### v1.5.0
- **Library: Archive button** — move the selected video(s) out to a separate Archive folder (set in Settings → Folders → Archive) instead of keeping every generation in the main Library. Meant for clips you want to keep but don't need front-and-center — watch them later in the standalone Desktop Video Browser
  - closes any player currently holding one of the files *before* the move, and deletes the file's cached thumbnail(s) from the Library's `thumbnails/` folder — otherwise a stale tile would linger in the grid and clicking it would try to play a file that's no longer there
  - a name clash in the archive folder is resolved with a `_2`, `_3`, … suffix rather than overwriting
- **Library: filename search + date-created filter.** With hundreds of videos piling up, the grid can now be narrowed by typing part of a filename, and/or by Year / Month / Day of the file's creation date (same two-dropdown pattern as the History dialog's date filter) — both combine, and a "N of M shown" label tracks the current filter

### v1.4.1
- **Fixed: a video you had played could not be deleted until the app was restarted** (`WinError 32 ... being used by another process`). Closing the player only called `stop()`, and on Windows that does not release the file - the media backend keeps the handle until the source is cleared or the player destroyed. Worse, the player window was never destroyed at all: it was parented to the main window and merely hidden on close, so every clip ever opened stayed locked, and starting another video just added a second hidden player on top
  - closing the player now clears its source, detaches the outputs and destroys the player and the window (`WA_DeleteOnClose`); the main window drops its reference the moment it closes
  - deleting a file the player currently holds closes that player first, then deletes - no need to close it yourself
  - the delete retries for up to ~1.2 s while the backend lets go of the handle, so a delete right after a close goes through
  - verified before/after on a real clip: locked while playing, **still locked after `stop()`**, free after the new close, deletable with zero delay
- Quitting the app closes any open player through the same path

### v1.4.0
*Ships everything from 1.3.9 onwards — those builds were interim and never released on their own.*

- **Fixed: deleting a file left its tile behind, and ↻ Refresh didn't clear it.** Two faults, both in the folder scanner:
  - **A rescan never let go of the scan already running.** `refresh()` asked the old loader to stop and waited up to 3 seconds, but a loader sitting in an ffmpeg last-frame extraction can't stop on the spot — and it was still connected to the grid. So it carried on emitting its *previous* listing into the freshly cleared view, deleted files included, and the folder looked like it hadn't been re-read. The loader is now disconnected the moment it's abandoned, so nothing it does afterwards can touch the grid
  - **The video scanner added a tile even when it couldn't make a thumbnail** — a grey placeholder — so a file deleted mid-scan came back as a stuck empty tile. Files that vanish during a scan are now skipped, checked both before and after the (slow) extraction step
- **Deleting in one tab clears the tile in the others.** The Library and the Video → Extend tab usually point at the same folder; the row is dropped from the other views immediately, without either of them rescanning
- Abandoned scans are parked until they actually finish rather than being dropped on the floor — a `QThread` garbage-collected while still running can take the whole app down with it
- The last-frame extraction gets a 30-second timeout (60 for the slow reverse-decode fallback), so a cancelled scan ends promptly instead of blocking on one bad file

### v1.3.14
- **Type-to-filter on the workflow dropdown.** Click the box and start typing: every workflow *containing* what you typed stays in the list, wherever the match falls — `makeout` finds `Video_MiniMax_Makeout on Bed/workflow_segment_01_batch.json`, `segment_03` finds all eleven of them. Case doesn't matter, and the match runs against the whole relative path, so a folder name filters as well as a file name
  - Qt's stock completer only matches from the first character, which is no use when the part you remember sits in the middle of the name
  - clicking the box selects the current entry, so typing replaces it instead of landing mid-word; text that matches nothing snaps back to the selected workflow when you click away
  - the ↻ button, the ⧉ Clone flow and the remembered selection all work exactly as before
- **The LoRA pickers filter the same way**, and there they keep whatever you type — a LoRA that lives on the server but not in your local folder is still accepted

### v1.3.13
- **Delete a file straight from the thumbnail grid**, on the Image → Video and Video → Extend tabs — a bad generation no longer means hunting it down in Explorer. Three ways in:
  - the 🗑 button in the folder row (greyed out until something is selected)
  - right-click a thumbnail → *Delete … (Recycle Bin)*
  - the **Del** key while the grid has focus
- **Deleted files go to the Recycle Bin**, not into thin air — including the Library's existing 🗑 Delete button, which used to remove them permanently. A permanent delete is the fallback only when the shell can't recycle (a network share, a full Bin), and anything that fails is reported by name
- Cached thumbnails for the deleted file (`thumbnails/<stem>.jpg`, `<stem>_last.jpg`, `<stem>_<crc>.jpg`) go with it, so a stale tile can't come back
- The grid drops the row and updates its count without a full folder rescan; the run panel follows the new selection. The Library keeps its single labelled button — the folder-row icon is hidden there rather than doubled up

### v1.3.12
- **Extension clips are marked `EXT`**, right before the timestamp: `<image>_<workflow>_EXT_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.mp4`. A clip from the Video → Extend tab is now obvious at a glance in the output folder, where before it looked exactly like an Image → Video result. Image runs are unmarked, and the stitched file keeps its own `_extended_<stamp>` name
- The marker is stripped along with the workflow label when the next extension is named, so it appears once and never stacks up

### v1.3.11
- **Extend output names stop growing with every pass.** Each run used to bolt its workflow and timestamp onto the whole previous file name, so extending an extension produced `<image>_<workflow A>_<stamp>_<workflow B>_<stamp>.mp4` (131 characters after one pass) and a chain of four or five runs would blow past the 260-character path limit Windows enforces. A video source now sheds what an earlier run appended and keeps only its own base name, so five chained extensions all land at the same length:
  - `grandfinals..._Video_MiniMax_Makeout_on_Bed_20260905_134013.mp4` → run through the Cumshot workflow → `grandfinals..._workflow_Cumshot_after_MO_on_bed_20260905_160000.mp4`
  - `_extended_<stamp>` is stripped the same way, so extending a stitched file works too
  - only names this app wrote are trimmed: a trailing timestamp is removed only when a known workflow label (or `extended`) sits in front of it, so a camera-style `IMG_20260101_120000.mp4` keeps its name intact
  - image sources are untouched — nothing compounds there
- **Every output name is capped to fit a 250-character path.** In a deep output folder the base name is shortened as far as needed; the workflow label, timestamp and extension are never cut, so files stay identifiable and the run can't fail on a path error

### v1.3.10
- **The Extend tab now checks the source video's codec against what the workflow is about to save.** The log opens every video run with `Source: 704x736 24fps h264`, and:
  - with *Append the new clip* ticked, the workflow **about to run** is retuned to match — `Output format: video/h265-mp4 -> video/h264-mp4 to match the source video (h264)`. Only the in-memory copy is touched; the workflow file on disk is never rewritten (use ⧉ Clone for that)
  - the replacement keeps the container and the encoder family, so `video/nvenc_hevc-mp4` becomes `video/nvenc_h264-mp4`, not plain h264
  - the options are read from the server that will run the job (`/object_info`), so a format that pod doesn't have is never written into the graph. If it has no match, the run says so instead of failing
  - with Append unticked it just notes the mismatch and changes nothing
  - a frame-rate difference (24 fps workflow, 16 fps source) is reported too, but never changed — that would alter the clip's speed
- **The stitched file keeps the source's codec family.** Extending an h265 video used to produce an h264 `_extended.mp4` several times the size; hevc sources are now written with libx265 (crf 20, `hvc1` tag), everything else with libx264 (crf 18)
- `probe()` reports the video codec, so `VideoProps` now carries `vcodec`

### v1.3.9
- **Fixed: "Append the new clip" failed with `ffmpeg concat failed ... Media type mismatch`.** When both clips carried audio (every MiniMax H3 clip does), the filter graph handed ffmpeg all the video streams and then all the audio streams. `concat` wants each segment's streams together — video, audio, video, audio — so it refused to link the graph and no `_extended.mp4` was written. The streams are now interleaved per segment
- **The new clip is generated at the source video's frame size when Append is ticked.** The Megapixels box was shrinking the extension (a 704x736 source produced a 640x672 clip at 0.40 MP), so the join needed an upscale. The source's own size is used instead — the log says `Appending - matching the source's 704x736: megapixels 0.494 (was 0.4)`, the run summary reads `MP: source video's size`, and the Megapixels box is left alone for every other run
- Stitching is harder to break in general:
  - a clip whose aspect ratio differs is fitted inside the first clip's frame and padded with black instead of being stretched
  - audio is resampled to one common format (48 kHz stereo), so clips recorded at different rates still join
  - a clip with no audio track gets matching silence, instead of the whole stitch losing its sound
  - odd frame sizes are rounded down to even, which libx264 requires
  - when ffmpeg still refuses, the error now lists each part's size, fps, duration and audio state plus the filter graph, so the cause is readable from the dialog

### v1.3.8
- **⧉ Clone button next to the workflow dropdown.** Copy the selected workflow under a new name and start editing the copy — the workflow you like is left exactly as it was. The dialog takes the new name (pre-filled with `<name> copy`; a name already in use is refused rather than silently overwritten), the destination subfolder of the Workflows folder (the original's folder by default), and two options:
  - *Start from the prompts, LoRAs and settings shown in the panel* (on by default) — whatever is on screen, saved or not, is written into the clone. Off makes a byte-for-byte copy of the file on disk
  - *Copy the prompt history too* — off by default; the original's history stays readable from 📜 History either way
- The clone becomes the tab's selected workflow the moment the dialog closes, is remembered across restarts, and appears in the other tab's dropdown too — without disturbing that tab's own selection or unsaved edits

### v1.3.7
- **Negative prompt is now a pop-out, not a box on the main window.** WAN 2.2 and other video workflows need a negative prompt, but it is boilerplate that hardly ever changes — so it collapses to a single row: the label, a one-line preview of the current text, and a **⤢ Edit** button that opens the same large editing window the positive prompt uses. The full text is still sent to ComfyUI, saved by "Save to workflow", and recorded in history exactly as before
- The whole Prompts pane therefore goes to the positive prompt, which is what gets rewritten every run. On a workflow with both prompts the positive editor went from roughly 60px to ~315px on a tall window (~170px on a 1080p screen) — a single-prompt MiniMax graph already had the pane to itself and gains a little too
- Options + LoRAs take at most 40% of the splitter (was 50%); that pane scrolls, and the splitter stays draggable and remembered per tab

### v1.3.6
- Progress bar no longer runs backwards near the end of a job. ComfyUI's post-sampling nodes (VAE decode, video save) emit step counts of their own; those were being folded back into the sampler count, so the bar dropped from e.g. 77% to 66% and the label flipped back to "Step 6/6". They now fill their own slice of the bar — the label reads "Saving video... 40/81" — and the bar only ever moves forward, reaching 100% when the finished file has been downloaded

### v1.3.5
- History dialog filters: **Workflow** (current workflow by default, "All workflows", or any other workflow that has history — with entry counts; entries from other workflows show their workflow name) and **Date** (All dates, or Year / Month / Day with a second dropdown listing only the periods that have entries, with counts). Text search applies on top of both. Delete removes the entry from whichever workflow file it belongs to

### v1.3.4
- Image → Video and Video → Extend tabs open with the thumbnail pane two columns wide so the prompt and settings panel gets the room; drag the divider or resize the window for more thumbnails

### v1.3.3
- The player now auto-closes at the end of the video everywhere, including playback from a tab's Results list (v1.3.2 only did it for the Library)
- "Save to workflow" log line now lists everything it wrote (prompts, LoRAs, steps, megapixels, length)

### v1.3.2
- Library playback closes the player automatically when the last selected video finishes (single video or playlist) — no more dismissing a window sitting on the final frame. Playback from a tab's Results list still stays open

### v1.3.1
- New app icon: crimson rounded tile with a white play triangle and film-strip perforations, generated with Z-Image Turbo on the RunPod ComfyUI (source kept as `app_icon_source.png`; `make_icon.py` rebuilds the multi-size `.ico` from it with rounded transparent corners). Embedded in the EXE and used by the window, taskbar, Start Menu and desktop shortcut

### v1.3.0
- **Steps control** in Options (next to Seed): shows the sampler step count found in the workflow (`KSampler`, `KSamplerAdvanced`, `BasicScheduler`…) and applies the value you set to every sampler node on each run — bump it for quality, drop it for quick tests, without opening the workflow. WAN 2.2 hi/lo `KSamplerAdvanced` pairs keep their split point proportional (8 steps split at 4 → 12 steps split at 6); a boundary at or past the old count still means "to the end". Hidden for workflows with no step input (e.g. fixed 4-step Turbo samplers)
- **Megapixels control** (same row as Length/Duration): shows the `megapixels` value of the workflow's `ImageScaleToTotalPixels` / `ResolutionSelector` nodes and applies what you set to all of them per run — small for quick tests, large for production. Hidden when the workflow has no numeric `megapixels` input (fixed width/height WAN graphs)
- Steps and Megapixels are written by "Save to workflow", recorded in every history entry, shown in the "Next run →" summary and the Library's Produced-by pane, and restored by "Use prompt + settings"
- The progress bar's step total now reflects the patched step count

### v1.2.0
- **Library tab** (modeled on the Chain Automator's): thumbnail grid of finished videos — the Output folder by default, or any folder (Settings > Folders > Library, or the … button on the tab) — with sort, multi-select, **Play** (selected videos back-to-back as a playlist, double-click plays one), **Delete** (with confirmation; removes cached thumbnails too), **Open Folder**, **Refresh**, and **Send to Extend**, which switches to the Video → Extend tab with that video selected as the source (switching the Extend folder if the video lives elsewhere)
- Library details pane: file size, resolution, fps, duration, audio yes/no, and a **Produced by** box showing the prompt, LoRAs/strengths, seed and length the video was generated with — looked up by result file name across every workflow's prompt history
- The Library refreshes itself when a run finishes
- Build script deploys even while the app is running: the in-use EXE is renamed aside (`ComfyUI_Video_Creator.old.exe`) and the new one copied in; the next launch picks it up

### v1.1.0
- **LoRA picker**: every LoRA node in the selected workflow (`LoraLoaderModelOnly`, `LoraLoader`, rgthree `Lora Loader Stack`, `MiniMaxH3TurboLoRA`) gets a row with an editable dropdown of LoRA files and its strength spinner(s). The list comes from the LoRAs folder (new Settings > Folders > LoRAs) or, with ⇣ Server, from the connected ComfyUI (`/models/loras`) so RunPod mode shows what the pod actually has. Changes apply per run; "Save to workflow" writes them into the JSON
- **Prompt history with settings**: every run (and every Save to workflow) appends an entry to the workflow's `<name>.prompt_history.json` — the same sidecar file the Chain Automator uses — recording the prompts, seed, length/duration, every LoRA + strength, mode, video input mode and source file; the result file name is attached when the run finishes. Exact repeats of the previous entry are not duplicated. New 📜 History dialog: search, preview, **Use prompt** or **Use prompt + settings** (restores LoRAs, strengths, seed and length), delete
- **Bigger prompt area**: the right panel is now a draggable vertical splitter — Prompts above, Options + LoRAs below (scrolls when short on room); the split position is remembered per tab. Each prompt has an **⤢ Expand** button that opens it in a large separate editor window
- A "Next run →" summary line under the workflow status always shows the LoRAs/strengths, seed and length the next run will use
- **Extend tab thumbnails now show each video's last frame** (the extension's starting point) with a hint under the sort box; cached as `<stem>_last.jpg` so they never clash with the Chain Automator's first-frame cache, and regenerated when the video changes
- Log and Results now sit side by side under the progress bar to give the prompts more vertical room

### v1.0.0
- Initial release. Standalone single-shot ComfyUI API workflow runner, deliberately separate from the Chain Automator so the two can evolve without affecting each other
- **Image → Video tab**: thumbnail grid of a chosen image folder (sortable, cached thumbnails shared with the Chain Automator's cache layout), pick a workflow, run
- **Video → Extend tab**: thumbnail grid of a chosen video folder; the selected video feeds the workflow either as its last frame (into a `LoadImage` / folder-loader node) or as the whole file (into a `LoadVideo` / `VHS_LoadVideo` node) — auto-detected, with a manual override. Optional "append the new clip to the source video" produces `<name>_extended_<stamp>.mp4` via ffmpeg concat (normalized size/fps, audio kept when both parts have it)
- **Workflow dropdown** lists every `.json` under the Workflows folder (subfolders included, prompt-history files skipped); UI-format exports are rejected with a message telling you to use Workflow > Export (API)
- Batch-style workflows that read a folder (`LoadImageListFromDir //Inspire`) work too: the single image is staged into a fresh run folder (uploaded to `input/VideoCreator/<run>` on RunPod, copied to a local staging folder otherwise) and the loader is pointed at it
- Prompt editor auto-built from the workflow: CLIPTextEncode positive/negative, MiniMax H3 `prompt`, PrimitiveStringMultiline; edits apply per run, "Save to workflow" writes them back into the JSON; adjustable text size
- Seed: random per run or fixed (with 🎲); Length/Duration control when the workflow exposes `WanImageToVideo.length` or an H3 "Float (duration)" node
- Local and RunPod modes with separate URLs and a "Test connection" button; results are always downloaded to the configured Output folder and named `<source>_<workflow>_<stamp>.mp4`
- Live websocket step progress (cumulative across multi-sampler WAN hi/lo passes, plus post-sampler decode/encode/save phases) with HTTP-polling fallback; Cancel interrupts the job on the server
- Built-in video player for results, Open Folder shortcuts, run log (`video_creator_run.log`, last 50 runs) next to the EXE
- Dark red theme; config `video_creator_config.json` lives next to the EXE; `ffmpeg.exe` shipped next to the EXE (configured path → app-local → PATH)
