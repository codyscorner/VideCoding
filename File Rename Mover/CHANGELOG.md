# Changelog

All notable changes to File Rename Mover will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.4.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- **Base Name folder option** — new checkbox under Folder Organization:
  "Create a folder named after the Base Name". When on, files land in
  `dest\[Base Name]\...` with any date organization created inside that folder,
  e.g. `dest\Sahara\2026\09\05\Sahara_000001.mp4`. Works with every structure
  including `flat` (which gives plain `dest\[Base Name]\`).
  - Saved in config (`base_name_folder`) and in templates; editable in the
    Edit Template dialog; shown in Manage Templates details.
  - Counter continuation scans only `dest\[Base Name]` when the option is on, so a
    large shared destination (NAS root) is not walked in full and files with the
    same base name elsewhere in the destination don't affect the numbering.
- **Preview button** — dry run that lists every planned move
  (`original → [Base Name]\yyyy\mm\dd\new_name`) in the status box without
  touching any files. Uses the same validation as Move and Rename.
- Folder Organization example line now updates live as you type the Base Name
  and toggle the checkbox.

### Changed
- `FolderOrganizer.get_destination_subfolder()` / `get_folder_structure_example()`
  take an optional `base_name_folder` argument.
- `FileRenamer.generate_preview()` now returns the relative destination path
  (subfolders included), not just the new filename.
- Input validation and option collection factored into
  `MainWindowQt._collect_operation()` shared by Preview and Move and Rename.
- Build spec excludes the shared venv's ML packages (torch, tensorflow, cv2, …)
  and PyQt5/PyQt6 so the EXE stays lean.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- Progress bar wired to a QThread worker; UI stays responsive during operations
- Cancel button aborts after the current file completes
- Source/Destination fields accept folders dragged from Windows Explorer

## [2.1.4] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed
- Fixed filename formatting to remove trailing underscore before extension
  - NumberingPattern: `photo_000001.jpg` instead of `photo_000001_.jpg`
  - DateTimePattern: `photo_20251208_000001.jpg` instead of `photo_20251208_000001_.jpg`
  - PrefixPattern: `backup_file.jpg` instead of `backup_file_.jpg`
- Fixed preview generation to use current pattern strategy instead of hardcoded legacy format
- Preview now respects sorting configuration and all pattern types

### Added
- Comprehensive filename validation and sanitization
  - Path traversal protection (blocks `..` in filenames)
  - Invalid character detection (blocks `<>:"/\|?*`)
  - Reserved Windows name validation (blocks CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1-9, LPT1-9)
- Enhanced extension validation with character checking
- Better error messages for validation failures

### Security
- Added protection against path traversal attacks
- Filename sanitization prevents directory traversal vulnerabilities
- Validates against Windows reserved filenames

## [2.1.1] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed
- Fixed SortBy enum conversion bug that caused "not a valid SortBy" error when using date_created or date_modified sorting
- Fixed folder path separators to use Windows backslashes (\\) instead of forward slashes (/) in UI examples
- Improved same-folder operation handling to properly distinguish between rename and move operations

### Added
- Added duplicate file checking to prevent overwriting existing files
- Added skip logic for files that already have the target name
- Enhanced status logging to show "Renamed:" vs "Moved:" for clarity

### Changed
- Improved error messages for file operation failures
- Better path handling for Windows-specific operations
